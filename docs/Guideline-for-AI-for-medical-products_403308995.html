                    <p><strong>This information is cloned from:<br/><a class="external-link" href="https://github.com/johner-institut/ai-guideline" rel="nofollow">GitHub - johner-institut/ai-guideline: Guideline for AI based Medical Devices</a><br/></strong></p><p><br/></p><ol><li><strong>A) Meta information</strong></li><li><strong> Objective of the guideline</strong></li></ol><p>The objective of this guideline is to provide medical device manufacturers, authorities and notified bodies instructions and to provide them with a concrete checklist to</p><ul><li>understand what the expectations of the notified bodies and authorities are,</li><li>to promote step-by-step implementation of safety of medical devices, that implement artificial intelligence methods, in particular machine learning,</li><li>to compensate for the lack of a harmonized standard (in the interim) to the greatest extent possible.</li></ul><p>The guideline is <strong>not</strong> meant to serve as a training manual or guideline to achieve the safety of AI based medical devices. It is to be a guideline for its review.</p><p>The annex lists the recitals which led to the development of this guideline.</p><ol><li><strong> Scope of applicability and target group</strong></li></ol><p>This guideline is only applicable to medical devices that use AI methods, in particular machine learning. The guideline applies in particular to</p><ul><li>Manufacturers of these products</li><li>Their service providers (such as engineering providers)</li><li>People and organizations that must assess the safety of these products, such as auditors, authorities and notified bodies.</li></ul><ol><li><strong> Instructions for use</strong></li><li><strong>a) Structure of the guideline</strong></li></ol><p>This guideline follows the thought that the safety of AI based medical products can only be achieved through a process-oriented approach, whereby all relevant processes and phases of the life cycle must be considered such as:</p><ol><li>Research and development</li><li>Data management</li><li>Post-market surveillance</li></ol><p>Accordingly, the guideline does not set forth specific requirements for the products, but for the processes. It contains the following chapters:</p><ol><li>General requirements</li><li>Requirements for product development</li><ol><li>Intended use</li><li>Software requirement specification</li><li>Data management</li><li>Model development</li><li>Product development</li><li>Product release</li></ol><li>Requirements for phases following development</li></ol><ol><li><strong>b) Binding character of the guideline</strong></li></ol><p>This guideline is neither a legal requirement nor a harmonized standard. Accordingly, there is no differentiation between normative and informative elements.</p><p>Much more, the guideline brings together best practices to best describe the required “state-of-the-art”.</p><p>Some of these best practices are not applicable in all situations, for all products or for all methods of machine learning. The manufacturers should at least justify non-obvious exclusions.</p><ol><li><strong>c) Use of the guideline</strong></li></ol><p><strong>Creating and reviewing specifications</strong></p><p>The manufacturers should first use the guideline to review the completeness of the specifications (process and work instructions, checklists, etc.). These tasks are normally assumed by the following roles:</p><ul><li>Process-related persons, in particular head of development</li><li>Quality manager and quality management deputy</li><li>Regulatory affairs manager</li></ul><p><strong>Assessing products and QM system</strong></p><p>Then the people responsible for the following tasks should use the guideline:</p><ul><li>Reviewing the conformity of products with the underlying safety and performance requirements</li><li>Assessing the conformity of the technical documentation with the regulatory requirements</li><li>Assessing the efficacy of the internal quality management system (e.g. for design reviews or audits)</li></ul><p>The following roles are normally responsible for these tasks:</p><ul><li>Quality managers</li><li>External and internal auditors (including notified bodies)</li><li>Internal and external reviewers of technical documentation (including notified bodies and authorities)</li><li>Testers</li><li>Data scientists</li><li>Clinical affairs specialists</li><li>Regulatory affairs manager</li><li>Risk manager</li></ul><ol><li><strong>d) Structure of the guideline</strong></li></ol><p>The guideline is a grouped list of review criteria according to the aforementioned  chapter. Each list element contains the following attributes:</p><ul><li>Clear ID</li><li>Review criteria, that can be simply assessed as met or not met</li><li>Comments</li></ul><p>The comments may contain:</p><ul><li>Note or reference to regulatory requirement</li><li>Recommendations for implementation of reference to additional explanations</li><li>Tips for auditors such as how the fulfillment of the criteria can be assessed</li><li>Notes on binding nature and applicability and limitations</li></ul><ol><li><strong> Authors and rights of use</strong></li></ol><p>The following authors created this guideline:</p><ul><li>Prof. Dr. Christian Johner (<a class="external-link" href="https://www.johner-institut.de/" rel="nofollow">Johner Institute</a>)</li><li><a class="external-link" href="https://christophm.github.io/" rel="nofollow">Christoph Molnar</a> (<a class="external-link" href="https://www.uni-muenchen.de/index.html" rel="nofollow">LMU Munich</a>)</li><li>Dr. Andreas Purde, Dr. Abtin Rad (<a class="external-link" href="https://www.tuev-sued.de/" rel="nofollow">TÜV SÜD</a>)</li><li>Prof. Dr. Christian Dierks (<a class="external-link" href="https://www.dierks.company/" rel="nofollow">Dierks + Company</a>)</li><li>Stefan Bunk (CTO) and Sven Piechottka (Government &amp; Regulatory Affairs) (<a class="external-link" href="https://www.merantix.com/healthcare/" rel="nofollow">Merantix</a>)</li></ul><p>The guideline is published under the (<a class="external-link" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/?lang=de" rel="nofollow">Creative Commons License</a>) of type <a class="external-link" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/" rel="nofollow">BY-NC-SA</a>.

Versions without a tag are documents in the draft stage.</p><ol><li><strong>B) General requirements</strong></li><li><strong> Process requirements</strong></li></ol><p>The manufacturers should cover all aspects listed below either in the procedural instructions or in the relevant plans to ensure that the safety of the product is systematically guaranteed. Normally, the following standard operating procedures or plans are affected:</p><ul><li>Development</li><li>Risk management</li><li>Data management</li><li>Verification or validation (if not part of development)</li><li>Post-market surveillance and vigilance</li><li>Service, installation, decommissioning</li><li>Customer communication</li><li>Management review (ISO 13485:2016 requires consideration of “applicable new or revised regulatory requirements”.)</li></ul><p>If the manufacturer outsources processes, the requirements apply accordingly. Examples would be a (software) development service provider or contract research organization to be required to consider the relevant chapters of this guideline.</p><ol><li><strong> Plans</strong></li></ol><p>The manufacturer should compile all product specific plans as required by respective regulations.</p><ul><li>Development plan (incl. verification and validation planning)</li><li>Post-market surveillance plan</li><li>Risk management plan</li><li>Clinical evaluation plan</li></ul><p><br/></p>
